You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position.  That's a goal. We're now one apiece.,Iron Man
We're tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.,Iron Man
That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. ,Iron Man
And... you've won. Congratulations. ,Iron Man
Fair game. Good sport.  Have fun?,Iron Man
"This thing on?  But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it's always you.",Iron Man
Couldn't stop him.,Iron Man
Neither could I.,Captain America
I lost the kid.,Iron Man
"Tony, we lost.",Captain America
"Is, uh...? ",Iron Man
It's okay.,Iron Man
What's wrong with him?,Iron Man
"Honestly, until this exact second, I literaly thought you were a Build-A-Bear.",Iron Man
"We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him.",Captain America
"Who told you that?  I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight.",Iron Man
Okay.,Captain America
He's unbeatable.,Iron Man
"Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?",Captain America
Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.,Iron Man
"Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.",Captain America
 I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -,Iron Man
Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that's what we needed!,Iron Man
"Well, that didn't work out, did it?",Captain America
"I said, ""we'd lose"". You said, ""We'll do that together too."" And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers.",Iron Man
Right?,Iron Man
Okay...,Iron Man
"Nah, nah. Here's my point. You know what?",Iron Man
" She's great, by the way.",Iron Man
"We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules!  I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar.",Iron Man
"Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide.",Iron Man
Tony!,Captain America
I'm fine. I...,Iron Man
"We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight too.",Captain America
So where is he?,Captain America
"Yeah, just like that.",Captain America
I know it will.,Captain America
Cause I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.,Captain America
Where are they?,Captain America
What did you talk about?,Captain America
"That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take. To try and become whole again, try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You gotta move on. Gotta to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we got to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed all of us.",Captain America
You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already. ,Captain America
And to see a friend.,Captain America
You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.,Captain America
"There's fewer ships, cleaner water.",Captain America
Sorry. Force of habit. ,Captain America
"You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us.",Captain America
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.,Captain America
I think we both need to get a life.,Captain America
 Is this an old message?,Captain America
Scott. Are you okay?,Captain America
"Scott, what are you talking about?",Captain America
"Wait, are you talking about a time machine?",Captain America
 Maguna? Morgan H. Stark. You want some lunch?,Iron Man
"Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. (Takes the helmet off Morgan's head. She emerges out smiling mischievously.)",Iron Man
There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.,Iron Man
That's what you want. How did you find this?,Iron Man
Really? Were you looking for it?,Iron Man
"You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her.",Iron Man
"Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?",Captain America
"Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?",Iron Man
(Tony giving a drink to him.) Thank you.,Captain America
"In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.",Iron Man
"No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?",Iron Man
"Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?",Iron Man
"Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?",Iron Man
I don't believe we would.,Captain America
"Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.",Iron Man
"I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?",Iron Man
Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.,Iron Man
"We did stand. And yet, here we are.",Iron Man
"That's right, Scott, I won't even. I got a kid.",Iron Man
"Good job. I'm saved.  I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six.",Iron Man
"Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance.",Captain America
"I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.",Iron Man
He's not wrong.,Captain America
"No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain.",Captain America
Bruce.,Captain America
Bruce.,Captain America
About we were saying...,Captain America
"Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please.",Iron Man
"Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.",Iron Man
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -,Iron Man
Shit!,Iron Man
" What are you doing up, little mess?",Iron Man
"No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her.",Iron Man
"'Cause I got some important shit going on here.  What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.",Iron Man
"Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on...  my mind.",Iron Man
"You done? Yeah, now you are.  That face goes there.",Iron Man
"A story... Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.",Iron Man
"Come on, that's your favorite story. I love you tons. ",Iron Man
" Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night.",Iron Man
"Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range. ",Iron Man
 What are you reading?,Iron Man
 What's new with composting?,Iron Man
"I figured it out, by the way.",Iron Man
Time travel.,Iron Man
That's right.,Iron Man
"Yeah, I know.",Iron Man
"No, I can't help everybody.",Iron Man
"Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop.",Iron Man
I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.,Iron Man
"Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby.",Captain America
"Good luck, Scott. You got this.",Captain America
What is this?,Captain America
What is this?,Captain America
Yeah yeah. Can you bring him back?,Captain America
It's a baby. ,Captain America
As a baby!,Captain America
Bring Scott back!,Captain America
Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby.,Iron Man
"Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?",Captain America
" That's the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should've cautioned you against it.",Iron Man
You did.,Captain America
"Oh, did I?  Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.",Iron Man
Me too.,Captain America
"We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice.",Iron Man
Sounds like a deal. ,Captain America
Tony...,Captain America
"Why? He made it for you.  Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.",Iron Man
"Thank you, Tony.",Captain America
"Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team.  ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?",Iron Man
We're working on that right now.,Captain America
" Ratchet, How's it going?",Iron Man
"Okay, so the ""how"" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.",Captain America
Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.,Iron Man
"Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.",Iron Man
Correct.,Iron Man
"Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?",Captain America
Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?,Iron Man
Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.,Iron Man
Yeah. Sullivan Street.,Iron Man
No. He lived in Toronto. Were you even paying attention?,Iron Man
"All right. We have a plan. Six Stones, three teams. One shot.",Captain America
"Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win.  Whatever it takes. Good luck.",Captain America
"All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green.",Iron Man
"All right, we all have our assignments. Two Stones uptown, one Stone, down. Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.",Captain America
Feel free to smash a few things along the way.,Captain America
"Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.",Iron Man
Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.,Captain America
"Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit  did nothing for your ass.",Iron Man
"No one asked you to look, Tony.",Captain America
 It's ridiculous,Iron Man
"They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet.",Iron Man
"You're small, but you're talking loud.",Iron Man
"All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor.",Iron Man
On it. Head to the lobby.,Captain America
Alright. I'll see you there.,Iron Man
Change of plans.,Captain America
Rumlow.  I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.,Captain America
We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.,Captain America
That's okay. Trust me.  Hail Hydra.,Captain America
"Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. It's go-time.",Iron Man
"Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus, please?",Iron Man
" All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go.",Iron Man
You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.,Iron Man
"Do it, Lang!",Iron Man
Window's closing. Pull my pin!,Iron Man
"MEDIC! You guys, some help!",Iron Man
Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.,Iron Man
"Oh, we blew it.",Iron Man
"Tony, what's going on? Tell me you found that cube.  Oh, you gotta be shitting me.",Captain America
 I'm not Loki. And I don't wanna hurt you.,Captain America
" Yeah, I know. I know.",Captain America
Bucky... is... alive!,Captain America
That is America's ass.,Captain America
Cap–,Iron Man
"Sorry, buddy. We got a– problem.",Iron Man
"Well, what are we gonna do now?",Captain America
"You know what? Give me a break, Steve. I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.",Iron Man
"You're repeating yourself, you know that? You're repeating yourself.",Iron Man
"Dude, come on.",Iron Man
I dropped the ball.,Iron Man
Is that what I did?,Iron Man
"Yeah, well if we don't try, then no one else is going home, either.",Captain America
"I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State.",Iron Man
When were they both there?,Captain America
They were there at a– I've a vaguely exact idea.,Iron Man
How vague?,Captain America
I know for a fact they were there–,Iron Man
And I know how I know.,Iron Man
"Well, it looks like we're improvising.",Iron Man
"Scott, get this back to the compound.",Iron Man
Suit up.,Iron Man
"0-4,",Iron Man
"0-4–
-",Captain America
"Uhh, 0-7.",Iron Man
"0-7.
-",Captain America
1-9-7-0.,Iron Man
Are you sure?,Captain America
"Thanks for the pep talk, pissant. 
Do you trust me?",Iron Man
I do.,Captain America
Your call.,Iron Man
Here we go.,Captain America
"Clearly, you weren't actually born here, right?",Iron Man
The idea of me was.,Captain America
"Right. Well, imagine
you're SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?",Iron Man
In plain sight.,Captain America
" Good luck on your
mission, Captain.",Iron Man
" 
Good luck on your
project, doctor.",Captain America
Not exactly.,Captain America
" 
Gotcha. Back in the game.",Iron Man
"Oh, yeah.",Iron Man
"Yeah, no, Dr. Zol– No, I haven't seen a soul.  Pardon me.",Iron Man
"No, sir. I'm a– a visitor from MIT.",Iron Man
Uh– Howard.,Iron Man
Howard– Potts.,Iron Man
Hi. ,Iron Man
Yeah–,Iron Man
"I'm fine. Just, long hours.",Iron Man
Yeah. That would be swell.,Iron Man
Okay.,Iron Man
"So, flowers and sauerkraut. You
got a big date tonight?",Iron Man
Congratulations.,Iron Man
"Yeah, sure. How far along is she?",Iron Man
I have a little girl.,Iron Man
What'd be so awful about that?,Iron Man
"So, where are you
at with names?",Iron Man
"Huh, Might wanna let that stew awwhile. You got time.",Iron Man
Wildly. Yeah.,Iron Man
"I literally pieced it together as I went along, I thought about what my Dad did, and–",Iron Man
"""No amount of money ever
bought a second of time.""",Iron Man
He did his best.,Iron Man
"Yeah, Howard– Everything's gonna be all right. Thank you– for everything– you've done for this country.",Iron Man
Do we know if she had family?,Iron Man
Yeah. Us.,Captain America
I just asked him a question–,Iron Man
"Wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet.",Captain America
It's not about that–,Iron Man
Yeah.,Iron Man
How do we know you will?,Captain America
"Good to go, yeah?",Iron Man
"You remember– everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years.",Iron Man
"F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol. Will you?",Iron Man
"Talk to me, Banner.",Iron Man
Bruce!,Captain America
Don't move him.,Iron Man
"Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man.  You lose this again, I'm keeping it.",Iron Man
What happened?,Captain America
"You messed with time.
It tends to mess back. You'll see.",Iron Man
What's he been doing?,Iron Man
Where are the stones?,Captain America
Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.,Iron Man
So we keep it that way.,Captain America
Yeah. And I don't much care.,Iron Man
Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.,Iron Man
Born out of blood.,Captain America
"Okay, Thor. Hit me.",Iron Man
AVENGERS!  –assemble.,Captain America
Get those stones as far away as possible!,Captain America
No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.,Iron Man
"Anyone see an ugly, brown van up there?",Captain America
"Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?",Iron Man
Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.,Captain America
"Hey. You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it.",Iron Man
You better be right.,Iron Man
"F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?",Iron Man
"Danvers, we need an assist here.",Captain America
And I– am– Iron Man.,Iron Man
" Hey, Pep..",Iron Man
"Don't worry, Bruce. Clip all the branches.",Captain America
"Me, too.",Captain America
"You're a good man, Sam. This one's on me, though.",Captain America
Don't do anything stupid 'till I get back.,Captain America
"It's gonna be okay, Buck.",Captain America
You bet.,Captain America
