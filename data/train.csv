Thanks. I think.,Captain America
To the little guys.,Captain America
All right. We’ll drink it after.,Captain America
I know this neighborhood. I got beat up in that alley. And that parking lot. And behind that diner.,Captain America
"You start running they’ll never let you stop. You stand up, push back. Can’t say no forever, right?",Captain America
"I guess I just don’t why you’d wanna join the army if you’re a beautiful dame. Or a beautiful… a woman. An agent, not a dame! You are beautiful, but…",Captain America
This is the longers conversation I’ve had with one. Women aren’t exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.,Captain America
"Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying. And the past few years just didn’t seem to matter that much. Figured I’d wait.",Captain America
The right partner.,Captain America
What are we doing here?,Captain America
It’s a little big. You save me any of that schnapps?,Captain America
 That wasn’t so bad.,Captain America
"It’s probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?",Captain America
No! Don’t! I can do this!,Captain America
 I did it.,Captain America
Taller.,Captain America
"Sorry!  Whoa, whoa, whoa!",Captain America
,Captain America
Who the hell are you?,Captain America

He deserved more than this.,Captain America
"Sir, if you’re going after Schmidt, I want in.",Captain America
The serum worked.,Captain America
"Sir, that’s all I want.",Captain America
 I don’t know if I can do this.,Captain America
It’s just not how I pictured getting there.,Captain America

Series E Defence Bonds. Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.,Captain America
Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.,Captain America
"We all know this is about trying to win the war. We can’t do that without bullets and bandages, tanks and tents. That’s where you come in. Every bond you buy will help protect someone you love. ",Captain America
"Keep our boys armed and ready, and the Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us. ",Captain America
How many of you ready to help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?  Okay. Uh… I need a volunteer.,Captain America

"Come on, guys. We’re all on the same team here.",Captain America
 Hi.,Captain America
What are you doin’ here?,Captain America
Yeah. Uh… I had to improvise a little bit. Crowds I’m used to are usually more uh… twelve.,Captain America
Bond sales take a ten percent bump in every state I visit.,Captain America
At least he’s got me doin’ this. Phillips would have had be stuck in lab.,Captain America
"You know for the longest time I dreamed about coming overseas and being on the front lines. Serving my country. I finally get everything I wanted, and I’m wearing tights.  They look like they’ve been through hell.",Captain America
The one-oh-seventh?,Captain America
Come on!  Colonel Phillips.,Captain America

"Please tell me if he’s alive, sir. B-A-R…",Captain America
What about the others? Are you planning a rescue mission?,Captain America
"But if you know where they are, why not at least…?",Captain America
I think I understand just fine.,Captain America
"Yes, sir. I do.",Captain America
If that’s what it takes.,Captain America
You don’t know that.,Captain America
"By the time he’s done that, it could be too late!  You told me you thought I was meant for more than this. Did you mean that?",Captain America
Then you gotta let me go. ,Captain America
"Just get me as close as you can.  You know, you two are gonna be in a lot of trouble at the lab.",Captain America
"Where I’m goin’, if anybody yells at me I can just shoot ‘em.",Captain America
"Well, let’s hope it’s good for somethin’. ",Captain America
So are you two…? Do you…? Fondue?,Captain America
Are you sure this thing works?,Captain America
"As soon as I’m free, you turn this thing around and get the hell outta here!",Captain America
The hell I can’t! I’m a Captain! ,Captain America
Fellas.,Captain America
I’m… Captain America.,Captain America
Is there anybody else? I’m looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.,Captain America

Yeah. I’ve knocked out Adolf Hitler over two hundred times.,Captain America
,Captain America
It’s me. It’s Steve.,Captain America
Come on.,Captain America
I thought you were dead.,Captain America
Come on.,Captain America
I joined the Army. ,Captain America
A little.,Captain America
So far.,Captain America
You’ve got no idea.,Captain America
"Then how come you’re running?  Come on, let’s go. Up.",Captain America
Let’s go. One at a time. ,Captain America
 Some of theres men need medical attention.,Captain America
I’d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.,Captain America
"Yes, sir.",Captain America
 Couldn’t call my ride.,Captain America
"The fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic.  I just got a quick look.",Captain America
These are the weapon factories we know about. Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isn’t on this map.,Captain America
"Yes, sir. I’ll need a team.",Captain America
"With all due respect, sir. So am I.",Captain America
Pretty much.,Captain America
What’s that?,Captain America
 Another round.,Captain America
How about you? You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?,Captain America
You know what? It’s kind of growing on me.,Captain America
Agent Carter.,Captain America
Sounds good.,Captain America
"Yes, ma’m. I’ll be there.",Captain America
Don’t take it so hard. Maybe she’s got a friend. ,Captain America
 Excuse me. I’m looking for Mr. Stark.,Captain America
"Oh! The…yeah! Well, that’s you know? Just doin’ what needed to be done.",Captain America
"Really, it’s not a big deal.",Captain America
Uh…I don’t think they were all married.,Captain America
"Well, that…you know? That…that depends on the definition of it really. ",Captain America
"Agent Carter, wait.",Captain America
"Peggy, that’s not what you thought it was.",Captain America
"Well, what about you and Stark? How do I know you two haven’t been… fonduing?",Captain America
Really? I didn’t think…,Captain America
It’s handier than you might think.,Captain America
What about this one? ,Captain America
What’s it made of?,Captain America
How come it’s not a standard issue?,Captain America
,Captain America
I had some ideas about the uniform. ,Captain America
"Yeah, I and I threw up?",Captain America
Now why would I do that?,Captain America
"We only got about a 10-second window. You miss that window, we’re bugs on a windshield.",Captain America
I know you did.  Get down!,Captain America
 Bucky! Hang on! Grab my hand! NO!,Captain America
" Dr. Erskine said that… the serum wouldn’t just effect my muscles, it would effect my cells. Create a protective system of regeneration and healing. Which means um…I can’t get drunk. Did you know that?",Captain America
Did you read the reports?,Captain America
Then you know that’s not true.,Captain America
I’m goin’ after Schmidt. I’m not gonna stop till all of Hydra is dead or captured.,Captain America
Why not? That’s exactly what we’re gonna do.,Captain America
He told me you were insane.,Captain America
Nothin’. I’m just a kid from Brooklyn.  I can do this all day.,Captain America
So am I! ,Captain America
Thanks! ,Captain America
 You’re late.,Captain America
Right. ,Captain America
Nope! ,Captain America
Not my future! ,Captain America
Come in. This is Captain Rogers. Do you read me?,Captain America
Peggy! Schmidt’s dead.,Captain America
That’s a little bit tougher to explain.,Captain America
There’s not going to be a safe landing. But I can try and force it down.,Captain America
There’s not enough time. This thing’s moving too fast and it’s heading for New York.  I gotta put her in the water.,Captain America
"Right now I’m in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer a lot of people are gonna die. Peggy, this is my choice.  Peggy?",Captain America
I’m gonna need a rain check on that dance.,Captain America
You got it.,Captain America
"You know, I still don’t know how to dance.",Captain America
We’ll have the band play somethin’ slow. I’d hate to step on your… ,Captain America
Where am I?,Captain America
 Where am I really?,Captain America
"The game, it’s from May, nineteen forty one. I know, cause I was there.  Now, I’m gonna ask you again. Where am I?",Captain America
Who are you? ,Captain America
Break what?,Captain America
Yeah. Yeah. I just…I had a date.,Captain America
"You’re here with a mission, sir?",Captain America
Trying to get me back in the world?,Captain America
"I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!",Iron Man
"Oh, I see. So it's personal?",Iron Man
"Good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.",Iron Man
"Well you have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?  Come on, it's okay, laugh.",Iron Man
"Yes, please.",Iron Man
"That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else?  You're kidding me with the hand up, right?",Iron Man
"Yes. It's very cool.  Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.",Iron Man
What's going on?,Iron Man
What have we got?,Iron Man
Yeah.,Iron Man
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!",Iron Man
Whoa!,Iron Man
Work it! Come on! We should just stay till the morning.,Iron Man
"Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?",Iron Man
I'm so sorry.,Iron Man
"Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great. So, when do we do it?",Iron Man
There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry.,Iron Man
"Wow! Would you look at that? That's something else. I don't have any of those floating around. Uh, we're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something. ",Iron Man
"Come on, honey bear.",Iron Man
There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...,Iron Man
"Worse things have happened. I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, will ya?",Iron Man
All right.,Iron Man
"Yeah, you can count on it.",Iron Man
"I know, I know.  Render unto Caesar, that which is Caesar's. There you go.",Iron Man
She's all right?  Hi.,Iron Man
Yeah. Okay--,Iron Man
Go.,Iron Man
Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.,Iron Man
That's not bad. Let me guess. Berkeley?,Iron Man
"Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.",Iron Man
Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.,Iron Man
I'd like to show you first-hand.,Iron Man
"Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, ""Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.""",Iron Man
"My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.",Iron Man
"Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.",Iron Man
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.,Iron Man
Give me an exploded view.,Iron Man
Log that.,Iron Man
Please don't turn down my music.,Iron Man
How'd she take it?,Iron Man
Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?,Iron Man
"That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there.",Iron Man
"I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?",Iron Man
Is it a good representation of his spring period?,Iron Man
So?,Iron Man
I need it. Buy it. Store it.,Iron Man
"Is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down...",Iron Man
Deflect it and absorb it. Don't transmit it back to me.,Iron Man
"What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?",Iron Man
I don't like it when you have plans.,Iron Man
It's your birthday?,Iron Man
I knew that. Already?,Iron Man
"Well, get yourself something nice from me.",Iron Man
And?,Iron Man
Yeah.,Iron Man
"You're welcome, Miss Potts... Okay.",Iron Man
You're good. I thought I lost you back there.,Iron Man
I got you. I got you.,Iron Man
What?,Iron Man
I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.,Iron Man
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll!,Iron Man
"What you reading, platypus?",Iron Man
"Come on, sour patch.",Iron Man
Don't be mad.,Iron Man
I said I was sorry.,Iron Man
I told you I was sorry.,Iron Man
"Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...",Iron Man
I respect you.,Iron Man
"Hey! Heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me.",Iron Man
You can't have sashimi without sake.,Iron Man
It would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap.,Iron Man
"Yes, two, please.",Iron Man
"Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...",Iron Man
Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?,Iron Man
General.,Iron Man
Thanks.,Iron Man
"Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries' Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it. And it's worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves. ",Iron Man
,Iron Man
"Obie, what are you doing up?",Iron Man
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.,Iron Man
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?,Iron Man
"I'm sorry, this is the ""fun-vee."" The ""hum-drum-vee"" is back there.",Iron Man
See you back at base.,Iron Man
What the hell did you do to me?,Iron Man
What is this?,Iron Man
I don't remember.,Iron Man
Where are we?,Iron Man
Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?,Iron Man
I refuse. ,Iron Man
I think you got a lot of my weapons.,Iron Man
"No, he won't. ",Iron Man
"Why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.",Iron Man
 How many languages do you speak?,Iron Man
Who are these people?,Iron Man
"Uh-huh.  Okay, we don't need this.",Iron Man
"That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other 11?",Iron Man
"Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.",Iron Man
What do I call you?,Iron Man
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.,Iron Man
That's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.,Iron Man
"If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second.",Iron Man
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.,Iron Man
 This is our ticket out of here.,Iron Man
Flatten them out and look. ,Iron Man
You still haven't told me where you're from.,Iron Man
Got a family?,Iron Man
No.,Iron Man
What does he want?,Iron Man
What do you want? A delivery date?  I need him. Good assistant.,Iron Man
"41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that's from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right.",Iron Man
Say something. Say something back to him.,Iron Man
Then speak Hungarian.,Iron Man
What do you know?,Iron Man
How'd that work?,Iron Man
That's what I do.,Iron Man
Initialize the power sequence.,Iron Man
Now!,Iron Man
Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar. It should be up right now.,Iron Man
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.,Iron Man
"Press Control ""l"".",Iron Man
"""I."" ""Enter.""",Iron Man
"""l"" and ""Enter."" Come over here and button me up.",Iron Man
Every other hex bolt.,Iron Man
"Nothing pretty, just get it done. Just get it done.",Iron Man
"Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?",Iron Man
Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan!  Yinsen! Yinsen!,Iron Man
Yinsen!,Iron Man
"Come on.  We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it.",Iron Man
"Come on, you're gonna go see your family. Get up.",Iron Man
Thank you for saving me.,Iron Man
My turn.  Not bad.,Iron Man
Hey!  Hey!,Iron Man
Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them.  Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?,Iron Man
"Yeah, vacation's over.",Iron Man
No.,Iron Man
No is a complete answer.,Iron Man
"I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...",Iron Man
...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.,Iron Man
Yeah.,Iron Man
"Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.",Iron Man
"No, I'm fine.",Iron Man
"Well, come on.",Iron Man
There's only one left. I need it.,Iron Man
"Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down? ",Iron Man
Good to see you.,Iron Man
"I never got to say goodbye to Dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions that I would have asked him. I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did. If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.",Iron Man
"Hey, Ben.",Iron Man
I had my eyes opened.  until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be.,Iron Man
"What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well. ",Iron Man
Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?,Iron Man
"Uh, optimistically, 40 points.",Iron Man
Yep.,Iron Man
"Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy.",Iron Man
It's my name on the side of the building.,Iron Man
Not based on what I saw. We're not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We're gonna do something else.,Iron Man
I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.,Iron Man
It works.,Iron Man
Maybe.,Iron Man
"That's what they say. Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?",Iron Man
It's Rhodey or Pepper.,Iron Man
"Okay, Rhodey. ",Iron Man
Okay? It works.,Iron Man
"I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay? But if I had...",Iron Man
That was Dad's line.,Iron Man
 Pepper. How big are your hands?,Iron Man
How big are your hands?,Iron Man
"Get down here. I need you.  Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed. I just uh.. need your help for a sec.",Iron Man
"It was. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.",Iron Man
It's nothing. It's just a little snag. There's an exposed wire under this device. And it's contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short. It's fine. ,Iron Man
Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant.,Iron Man
"I want you to reach in, and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.",Iron Man
"Yeah, it should be fine. It's like Operation. You just don't let it touch the socket wall or it goes ""beep.""",Iron Man
"It's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire.",Iron Man
Okay? Great.,Iron Man
"No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great. Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...",Iron Man
I really need your help here.,Iron Man
"It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, not from my body.",Iron Man
"Yeah, it does. The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?",Iron Man
"Okay, you got it? Now, don't let it touch  the sides when you're coming out!",Iron Man
"That's what I was trying to tell you before. Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, that you don't...  There's a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out.",Iron Man
"Okay, I was not expecting...",Iron Man
Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!,Iron Man
"Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest--",Iron Man
'cause you yanked it out like a trout... We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this. You gotta switch it out really quick.,Iron Man
What?,Iron Man
Is it?,Iron Man
"Let's hope. Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate. Make s-sure you...  Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here. Nice.",Iron Man
"Yeah, I feel great. You okay?",Iron Man
I don't have anyone but you. Anyway... ,Iron Man
That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.,Iron Man
"Pepper, I've been called many things. ""Nostalgic"" is not one of them.",Iron Man
"That will be all, Miss Potts.  Hey, Butterfingers, come here. What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.",Iron Man
Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?,Iron Man
"Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987. That lovely lady you woke up with.",Iron Man
What was his name?,Iron Man
Was it Ivan?,Iron Man
Okay.,Iron Man
Okay.,Iron Man
Pleasure meeting you.,Iron Man
Why?,Iron Man
I'm doing a little better than walking.,Iron Man
"Yeah. Rhodey, I'm working on something big. I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it.",Iron Man
This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.,Iron Man
I need you to listen to me.,Iron Man
Okay.,Iron Man
Thanks.,Iron Man
"JARVIS, you up?",Iron Man
"I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two.",Iron Man
"Actually, I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server?",Iron Man
"I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.",Iron Man
"Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don't even move. You are a tragedy.",Iron Man
"Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We're gonna start off nice and easy. We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one.",Iron Man
"Up two. All right, set that.",Iron Man
"Yeah, everything's... What? ",Iron Man
Great!,Iron Man
Great. I'll be right up.,Iron Man
"It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless.  How'd it go? It went that bad, huh?",Iron Man
"Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.",Iron Man
"Uh-huh. You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing. I lay low, and you take care of all...",Iron Man
This was a board of directors meeting?,Iron Man
A what?,Iron Man
"Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen.",Iron Man
It doesn't matter. We own the controlling interest in the company.,Iron Man
"I'm being responsible! That's a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great. ",Iron Man
I'll be in the shop.,Iron Man
"No. No, absolutely not.",Iron Man
"This one stays with me. That's it, Obie. Forget it.",Iron Man
Thank you.,Iron Man
"Good night, Obie. ",Iron Man
" No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Yeah, I can fly.",Iron Man
"JARVIS, are you there?",Iron Man
Engage heads-up display.,Iron Man
Import all preferences from home interface.,Iron Man
"All right, what do you say?",Iron Man
Can we start the virtual walk-around?,Iron Man
Do a check on control surfaces,Iron Man
"Uh, yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control.",Iron Man
"JARVIS! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one.  Handles like a dream. All right, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?",Iron Man
Records are made to be broken! Come on! ,Iron Man
"Keep going! Higher!  We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice!",Iron Man
Kill power.,Iron Man
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude. Hull pressurization is problematic. I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.,Iron Man
Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?,Iron Man
Thrill me.,Iron Man
"JARVIS, we get an invite for that?",Iron Man
"A little ostentatious, don't you think?",Iron Man
Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.,Iron Man
"Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.",Iron Man
"Don't wait up for me, honey.",Iron Man
"Sure don't. You look great, Hef.",Iron Man
What's the world coming to when a guy's got to crash his own party?,Iron Man
I'll see you inside.,Iron Man
You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute. Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.,Iron Man
Yeah?,Iron Man
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the..",Iron Man
"God, you need a new name for that.",Iron Man
Let's just put something on the books.,Iron Man
"Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right. Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn't recognize you.",Iron Man
Just avoiding government agents.,Iron Man
Yes. Where'd you get that dress?,Iron Man
That's great.,Iron Man
"Well, I got great taste.",Iron Man
You want to dance?,Iron Man
"All right, come on.",Iron Man
Am I making you uncomfortable?,Iron Man
You look great and you smell great.,Iron Man
But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.,Iron Man
I'd make it a week. Sure.,Iron Man
Five.,Iron Man
Right.,Iron Man
"The other eight? So, I got you for the other eight. How about a little air?",Iron Man
Totally harmless.,Iron Man
We're dancing. No one's even watching.,Iron Man
I think you lost objectivity. I think they just... People... We just danced.,Iron Man
I don't think it was taken that way.,Iron Man
I just think you're overstating it.,Iron Man
"Got it, okay.",Iron Man
Okay.,Iron Man
"Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you?",Iron Man
"Oh, hey.",Iron Man
Carrie.,Iron Man
Carrie.,Iron Man
That's right.,Iron Man
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.,Iron Man
Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you.,Iron Man
"I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear.",Iron Man
When were these taken?,Iron Man
I didn't approve any shipment.,Iron Man
"Well, I'm not my company.",Iron Man
Have you seen these pictures? What's going on in Gulmira?,Iron Man
"You know what? I was naive before, when they said, ""Here's the line. We don't cross it. This is how we do business."" If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we?",Iron Man
He's all yours.,Iron Man
Hello?,Iron Man
Who's this?,Iron Man
"Sorry, hello?",Iron Man
"Speak up, please.",Iron Man
"Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.",Iron Man
"It's funny how that works, huh?",Iron Man
"Well, that's a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?",Iron Man
"I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.",Iron Man
"Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.",Iron Man
Nope!,Iron Man
That's my exit.,Iron Man
Hit it.,Iron Man
Flares!,Iron Man
Deploy flaps!,Iron Man
"Hi, Rhodey, it's me.",Iron Man
"I'm sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me.",Iron Man
This is not a piece of equipment. I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!,Iron Man
"Hey, thanks.",Iron Man
"Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?",Iron Man
Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?,Iron Man
Hey!,Iron Man
"Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. I really should be able to...",Iron Man
Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.,Iron Man
"Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This'll get you in. It's probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.",Iron Man
"Same drill. They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them. I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them.",Iron Man
There is nothing except this. There's no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else.,Iron Man
"You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?",Iron Man
"I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.",Iron Man
 Good boy.,Iron Man
Where's Pepper?,Iron Man
That's not going to be enough.,Iron Man
"Not bad, huh? Let's do it.",Iron Man
Keep the skies clear.,Iron Man
How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up?,Iron Man
Keep me posted. Pepper!,Iron Man
I'm fine. How are...,Iron Man
"I know. Listen, you'd better get out of there.",Iron Man
Get out of there right now!,Iron Man
Stane!,Iron Man
Put them down!,Iron Man
Divert power to chest RT.,Iron Man
"Lady! No, no, no, no, no, no!",Iron Man
Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.,Iron Man
I know the math! Do it!,Iron Man
Climb!,Iron Man
Keep going!,Iron Man
Just leave it on the screen! Stop telling me!,Iron Man
How'd you solve the icing problem?,Iron Man
Might want to look into it.,Iron Man
Woah! Potts!,Iron Man
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.,Iron Man
Weapons status?,Iron Man
Flares!,Iron Man
Potts?,Iron Man
This isn't working. We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.,Iron Man
"You're going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know. You're going to hit the master bypass button. It's going to fry everything up here.",Iron Man
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time. This looks important! ,Iron Man
Pepper!,Iron Man
Time to hit the button!,Iron Man
Just do it!,Iron Man
Push it!,Iron Man
"""Iron Man."" That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean, it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold-titanium alloy, but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.",Iron Man
Okay?,Iron Man
Yeah.,Iron Man
"See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island.",Iron Man
All right.,Iron Man
There's nothing about Stane here.,Iron Man
"But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard? He's my... I mean, is that... That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?",Iron Man
"You know, it's actually not that bad. Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.",Iron Man
Am so.,Iron Man
"All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I'd become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night.",Iron Man
You know.,Iron Man
"Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.",Iron Man
Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...,Iron Man
"I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.",Iron Man
"Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.",Iron Man
"Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man.",Iron Man
Jarvis!,Iron Man
Who the hell are you?,Iron Man
 Ah.,Iron Man
